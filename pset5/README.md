update50
mkdir ~/workspace/pset5/

## [Academic Honesty](#academic-honesty)

Do keep in mind the course's policy on [academic honesty](https://docs.cs50.net/2018/x/syllabus.html#academic-honesty), particularly its "regret clause."

## [Problems](#problems)

* Implement [Speller](speller/speller.html)

### [Big Board](#big-board)

If you'd like to put your code to the test against classmates' code (just for fun), execute the command below to challenge the Big Board before or after you submit.

```
check50 cs50/2018/x/challenges/speller
```

Then visit the URL that `check50` outputs to see where you rank!
