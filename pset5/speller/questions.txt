## According to its man page, what does `getrusage` do?

GETRUSAGE(2)                BSD System Calls Manual               GETRUSAGE(2)

NAME
     getrusage -- get information about resource utilization

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/resource.h>

     #define   RUSAGE_SELF     0
     #define   RUSAGE_CHILDREN     -1

     int
     getrusage(int who, struct rusage *r_usage);

DESCRIPTION
     getrusage() returns information describing the resources utilized by the cur-
     rent process, or all its terminated child processes.  The who parameter is
     either RUSAGE_SELF or RUSAGE_CHILDREN.  The buffer to which r_usage points
     will be filled in with the following structure:

     struct rusage {
             struct timeval ru_utime; /* user time used */
             struct timeval ru_stime; /* system time used */
             long ru_maxrss;          /* max resident set size */
             long ru_ixrss;           /* integral shared text memory size */
             long ru_idrss;           /* integral unshared data size */
             long ru_isrss;           /* integral unshared stack size */
             long ru_minflt;          /* page reclaims */
             long ru_majflt;          /* page faults */
             long ru_nswap;           /* swaps */
             long ru_inblock;         /* block input operations */
             long ru_oublock;         /* block output operations */
             long ru_msgsnd;          /* messages sent */
             long ru_msgrcv;          /* messages received */
             long ru_nsignals;        /* signals received */
             long ru_nvcsw;           /* voluntary context switches */
             long ru_nivcsw;          /* involuntary context switches */
     };



## Per that same man page, how many members are in a variable of type `struct rusage`?

16

## Why do you think we pass `before` and `after` by reference (instead of by value) to `calculate`, even though we're not changing their contents?

You are passing the address of before and after so you can operate on those original variables and not values that may have been changed elsewhere.


## Explain as precisely as possible, in a paragraph or more, how `main` goes about reading words from a file. In other words, convince us that you indeed understand how that function's `for` loop works.

After checking for correct arguments, you set up getrusage so you can print the statistics at the end.
If arguments == 3, the user specified which dictionary to use.  Otherwise, load the text file to read.
For each character read in the file, if it's and alpha-character, append it to the word, otherwise it is a new word.
When you have a new word, update the word counter.
Check the spelling, update the rusage benchmark.
If the word is misspelled, add it to the number of misspellings and print the word.
Then get the next word.

## Why do you think we used `fgetc` to read each word's characters one at a time rather than use `fscanf` with a format string like `"%s"` to read whole words at a time? Put another way, what problems might arise by relying on `fscanf` alone?

Read each character to determine if it is a backslash, apostrophe or non-alphabetic character.


## Why do you think we declared the parameters for `check` and `load` as `const` (which means "constant")?

So we could not change them in our implementation.
