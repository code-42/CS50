## According to its man page, what does `getrusage` do?

GETRUSAGE(2)                BSD System Calls Manual               GETRUSAGE(2)

NAME
     getrusage -- get information about resource utilization

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/resource.h>

     #define   RUSAGE_SELF     0
     #define   RUSAGE_CHILDREN     -1

     int
     getrusage(int who, struct rusage *r_usage);

DESCRIPTION
     getrusage() returns information describing the resources utilized by the cur-
     rent process, or all its terminated child processes.  The who parameter is
     either RUSAGE_SELF or RUSAGE_CHILDREN.  The buffer to which r_usage points
     will be filled in with the following structure:

     struct rusage {
             struct timeval ru_utime; /* user time used */
             struct timeval ru_stime; /* system time used */
             long ru_maxrss;          /* max resident set size */
             long ru_ixrss;           /* integral shared text memory size */
             long ru_idrss;           /* integral unshared data size */
             long ru_isrss;           /* integral unshared stack size */
             long ru_minflt;          /* page reclaims */
             long ru_majflt;          /* page faults */
             long ru_nswap;           /* swaps */
             long ru_inblock;         /* block input operations */
             long ru_oublock;         /* block output operations */
             long ru_msgsnd;          /* messages sent */
             long ru_msgrcv;          /* messages received */
             long ru_nsignals;        /* signals received */
             long ru_nvcsw;           /* voluntary context switches */
             long ru_nivcsw;          /* involuntary context switches */
     };



## Per that same man page, how many members are in a variable of type `struct rusage`?

16

## Why do you think we pass `before` and `after` by reference (instead of by value) to `calculate`, even though we're not changing their contents?

TODO

## Explain as precisely as possible, in a paragraph or more, how `main` goes about reading words from a file. In other words, convince us that you indeed understand how that function's `for` loop works.

TODO

## Why do you think we used `fgetc` to read each word's characters one at a time rather than use `fscanf` with a format string like `"%s"` to read whole words at a time? Put another way, what problems might arise by relying on `fscanf` alone?

TODO

## Why do you think we declared the parameters for `check` and `load` as `const` (which means "constant")?
