# Harvard CS50 Final Project: BrooklynToken

See my youtube video here => https://youtu.be/ty8KRLJEyXI

This project is an HTML UI front-end implementation I wrote for an Ethereum Solidity dApp back-end program written by
my CareerDevs fellow student [Tim Wheeler](https://codesnippet.io/creating-your-own-cryptocurrency).

Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain.
The beauty of it, as relates to **CS50**, is that it is influenced by JavaScript, Python, C and C++.
Solidity is object-oriented much like JavaScript, is statically typed and uses structs just like C,
supports multiple inheritance, and libraaries.

This project started at the [BK Urban Blockchain Hackathon](https://www.brooklyntechweek.org/schedule/bk-urban-hackathon)
on November 9-10, 2018 in Brooklyn, NY.  Approximately 15 CareerDevs students made the trek to Brooklyn to participate in this unique event.
We were joined by approximately 80 other participants from around the world.

This is a small simple app (dApp) that transfers tokens from one blockchain address to another.
It doesn't do much else yet, but it's the beginning of my blockchain programming journey.
Thinking long term, an app like this could be used to pay your bills with onLine banking,
or send money (Ether) to another person or entity, or engage in some online gambling or lottery tickets,
and have an immutable record of that transaction.

The front-end HTML User Interface is hosted on [Amazon S3](http://brooklyn-token-dapp.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com)
<= click there to get to the app (dApp).

The back-end Solidity dApp is hosted on the [Ropsten Etherscan TestNet](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xd74a0f3606dbc4ad636760a751ecacbbc294d288#code)
<= click there to see the smart contract.

You must have MetaMask browser plug-in installed in your Chrome Firefox or Opera browser for this blockchain app (dApp) to work.
There are other browser plug-ins available for running blockchain dApps in your browser,
but MetaMask is by far the most popular and the one I recommend.
So if you don't have MetaMask installed, head on over to [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and install it.

The project is also hosted on the CS50 IDE on Cloud9.
